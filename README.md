# .NET Core base project

![.NET Core (Restore, Build and Test)](https://github.com/nruizneiman/netcore-base/workflows/.NET%20Core%20(Restore,%20Build%20and%20Test)/badge.svg)

This project wants to be a start point for new projects, as well as an example for new developers about how to use some technologies, patterns, and best practices.

Also, this repository was created as a template repository, so you can create a new project by using the "Use this template" button, or [clicking here](https://github.com/nruizneiman/netcore-base/generate).

Please feel free to collaborate, open issues, and don't forget to give me your star!

# Technologies used
- .NET 8
- EntityFramework Core
- MediatR
- Docker

## DB Providers
You can use multiple DB Providers by changing the "DbProvider" setting with one of the following values:
- `SqlServer`
- `InMemory` _(Default)_
- `MySQL`
- `PostgreSQL`

Also, you can add a new DB Provider as well.

# How to startup the project
First, you need to know what you want to do. Maybe a WebApplication, an API?

Second, set the project you want to start as a default project and run it!

Maybe you will need to update the connection string of the provider that you want to use to a local one before starting the project.
